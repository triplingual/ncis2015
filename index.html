					<h1>Digital Humanities on a Shoestring</h1>

							I know that there's a wide range of disciplines, ages, origins, and comfort (or discomfort) with technology in the room.
						</p>
						<p>
							Can I get a show of hands of who's ever done anything that they would call Digital Humanities? I don't care a fig whether it's something that's been stamped DH by anyone else, I'm interested in whether <strong>you</strong> think you've done something in Digital Humanities.
						</p>
						<p>
							With that, I can calibrate a bit how I talk about the things I'm going to say. It won't change the things, but I might speed some parts up.

					<h1 class="intertitle">Some Tools</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							For a few moments, I'm going to run through some tools that don't cost any money. You'll note my careful evasion of the word 'free' there, which I'll come back to in the second half.
						</p>
						<p>
							I'm intentionally just running names here. These are some heavily used tools, so if you note the names and search for them in your preferred search engine, you'll find them.

						<h2>R</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								R is often called the Swiss Army knife of data processing, and it's quite a tool. It's not easy to learn, but its rewards are significant.

						<h2>QGIS</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>http://maps.cga.harvard.edu/qgis/</p>
							<p>
								So while spatial humanities is not <strong>just</strong> GIS, it can be GIS, and this is an open source option for working with GIS. Like any open source tool, it can be frustrating. The community around it can also be frustrating.

						<h2>D3</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								D3 is based in JavaScript, and can do very simple things as well as it does very complex things. Which makes it good for making maps that use non-GIS data as well as for making maps that do.

						<h2>Indigenous Spaces</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								I'm cheating here, since this isn't a tool, but rather a special mention and request: If your research area could include indigenous representations of space, DH could use work in this area. We need to remember that Cartesian space is a recent invention.

							</p>
							<p>
								Honestly, I have no experience with this. But R seems to be able to do anything else, so I took a look and indeed it seems that you can do some image analysis using it. As with some other DH tools, its origins are in the sciences. The most interesting package seems to be EBImage, which comes from researchers needing to work with images generated by microscopy.

					<h1 class="intertitle">People</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							You may have heard it elsewhere, but it's worth repeating or saying to you fresh: Digital Humanities is people.
						</p>
						<p>
							And yet. Machines don't do anything scholarly significant by themselves yet. To engage in DH, there has to be another person in the room. To my mind, to engage in meaningful DH you have to address the lives of real humans. To expand human knowledge and to improve humanity, you'll get farther working with people than with computers.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is not to discount the tools I've mentioned before. But it does mean that the tools were written by people, are supported by people, have been used by people, are interpreted by people, and &#8212; most to the point &#8212; answer human questions that humans need to push forward using their own brains.
						</p>
						<p>
							It also means that tools, their intentions, their communities, and their biases reflect, reproduce, and reinforce pre-existing power structures and relations.
						</p>

					<h2>Partnering</h2>
					<h3>Or, Independent Scholars Can't Be</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							I've listed some approaches and some tools that enable those approaches, but you'll get farther faster if you have a team to work with.
						</p>
						<p>
							One team I'm part of has a photography historian and theorist as a PI, an American Studies scholar with a background in public scholarship as a project co-coordinator, a statistician as the other project co-coordinator, a geographer for the maps, and a Scandinavianist as the implementation lead, to say nothing of the librarians, government staff, and ad hoc consultations that have boosted the project.
						</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Keeping Up</h2>
					<h3>Or, Forming Virtual Community</h3>
					<p>
						Much of the real information on how to use these tools is kept in blogs, discussion forums, and Twitter.
					</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							Reading is still free, as is Twitter, the most significant social media vector for Digital Humanities.
