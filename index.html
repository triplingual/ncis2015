					<h1 class="intertitle">Some Tools</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							For a few moments, I'm going to run through some tools that don't cost any money. You'll note my careful evasion of the word 'free' there, which I'll come back to in the second half.
						</p>
						<p>
							These are some heavily used tools, so if you note the names and search for them in your preferred search engine, you'll find them.
						</p>

						<h2>Texts</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Voyant</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								I like Voyant as an introductory tool because it foregrounds very quickly the need to know some rudimentary statistics and even corpus linguistics to get very far.
							</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>MALLET</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Came out of UMASS Amherst, grad student (David Mimno), now hosted on GitHub
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>AntConc</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								Developed and supported by a corpus linguist. Word counts, collocates.
							</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>R</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								R is often called the Swiss Army knife of data processing, and it's quite a tool. It's not easy to learn, but its rewards are significant.
							</p>
						</aside>
					</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Spaces</h2>
						<p style="font-style:italic;">
							Note: Spatial Humanities is not just GIS
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Google Maps</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Great for sketching out ideas, rapid prototyping. But consider the advantages and disadvantages to giving Google your intellectual property.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>QGIS</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								Recent tutorial (as of June 2015, at least) from the Baruch Geoportal. http://www.baruch.cuny.edu/geoportal/practicum/
							</p>
							<p>
								So while spatial humanities is not just GIS, it can be GIS, and this is an open source option for working with GIS. Like any open source tool, it can be frustrating. The community around it can also be frustrating.
							</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>D3</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								http://d3js.org
							</p>
							<p>
								D3 is based in JavaScript, and can do very simple things as well as it does very complex things. Which makes it good for making maps that use non-GIS data as well as for making maps that do.
							</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>R</h2>
						<p>
							Remember R?
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>A host of links to follow: http://spatial.ly/r/</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Indigenous Spaces</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								I'm cheating here, since this isn't a tool, but rather a special mention and request: If your research area could include indigenous representations of space, DH could use work in this area. Cartesian space is a recent invention.
							</p>
							<p>
								It's also a good moment to add to my statement about GIS that not all digital mapping is interactive or dynamic. Spatial humanistic inquiry can result in rich, descriptive, provocative &#8212; and static &#8212; illustrative maps.

						<h2>Networks</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Gephi</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Cytoscape</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								Gephi and Cytoscape do very similar things. Gephi is more part of the lingua franca of DH, but that doesn't make it better.
							</p>
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Palladio</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								Often described as a data visualization platform, one approach this tool from Stanford can enable is network representation.

						<h2>Images</h2>

						<h2>Image Plot</h2>

						<h2>Python</h2>

						<h2>R</h2>
						<p>
							O HAI
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<p>
								e.g. http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/EBImage.html
							</p>
							<p>
								Honestly, I have no experience with this. But R seems to be able to do anything else, so I took a look and indeed it seems that you can do some image analysis using it. As with some other DH tools, its origins are in the sciences. The most interesting package seems to be EBImage, which comes from researchers needing to work with images generated by microscopy.

				<section>
					<h1 class="intertitle">People</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							You may have heard it elsewhere, but it's worth repeating or saying to you fresh: Digital Humanities is people.
						</p>
						<p>
							And yet. Machines don't do anything scholarly significant by themselves yet. To engage in DH, there has to be another person in the room. To my mind, to engage in meaningful DH you have to address the lives of real humans. To expand human knowledge and to improve humanity, you'll get farther working with people than with computers.
						</p>
						<p>
							This is not to discount the tools I've mentioned before. But it does mean that the tools aren't independent. Though your choice of tools affects the questions you can investigate, the tools are there to do your bidding. They were written by people, are supported by people, have been used by people, are interpreted by people, and &#8212; most to the point &#8212; answer human questions that humans need to push forward using their own brains.
						</p>
						<p>
							It also means that tools, their intentions, their communities, and their biases reflect, reproduce, and reinforce pre-existing power structures and relations.
						</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Keeping Up</h2>
					<h3>Or, Forming Virtual Community</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							Much of the real information on how to use these tools is packed away in people's heads and shared in blogs, discussion forums, and Twitter. Keeping up is labor, and part of why I don't call these tools 'free'.
						</p>
						<p>
							Reading is still free, as is Twitter, the most significant social media vector for Digital Humanities.
						</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Learning How to DH</h2>
					<h3>Or, You Get What You Give</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							This is a little facile, but no less true. At the beginning, I mentioned that the tools I would enumerate didn't cost any money. But they're not free, at least in the economics sense of the word, because they take an investment of time, effort, and human interaction. The more you work on learning a DH approach in a network of others working with the same or a similar approach, the more you'll be able to contribute to others' learning and therefore the better a position you'll be in to join or start a project team.
						</p>
						<p>
							This can be particularly important when the power structures that a tool and its community are reproducing are biased against you.
						</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Partnering</h2>
					<h3>Or, Independent Scholars Can't Be</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						<p>
							I've listed some approaches and some tools that enable those approaches, and I've talked about making connections and building your capabilities. Eventually, this leads to partnering on a project. I'm toying with the idea that you know you have become a digital humanist when you can start or work on a project with people from a computational or quantitative discipline.
						</p>
						<p>
							I'm part of the Photogrammar project, which you may have heard about yesterday from Lauren Tilton. On the project. there's a statistician as a project co-coordinator, and a geographer specializing in GIS for the maps, in addition to humanists and hybrid humanist-technologists. Part of the reason I have such respect for the team and the project is that the conversations all flow seamlessly. Everyone's learning, everyone's contributing.
						</p>
						<p>
							You also may have heard yesterday from Holly Rushmeier at Yale on using digital tools for visual analysis. The project she spoke of bridges members of Computer Science, English, and History, as well as staff with a range of experise.
						</p>
						<p>
							It's these kinds of robust, diverse teams that produce, use, and interpret good tools for Digital Humanities, and that I hope you're a little closer to forming or joining after today.
